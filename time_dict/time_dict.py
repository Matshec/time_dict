class TimeDict:
    """
    This class represents self-updating structure that is able to handle updating and removing object based on age.
    Objects added to this structure are assigned timestamp at insertion, then when age of object is exceeded optional
    action function is called and object is removed from the structure.

    NOTE: when you are using this structure you must explicitly delete it due to thread locking either by
    calling destroy() method or deleting it as del d  or the interpreter will hang at exit

    EXAMPLE USAGE:
        cache = TimeDict(action_time=2, poll_time=0.5)
        key = '1'
        cache[key] = 1
        key in cache
        del cache

    Main parameters are:
        action_time - which specifies age in second at which objects should be deleted - time when actions should
                      be performed and object will be deleted from structure
        poll_time - frequency in seconds of polling the objects for age timeout,
                    experimentally should be around 1/4 of the action_time or less. Please not that too frequent polling
                    may negatively affect you application performance
        action - function that is called on object age timeout. Signature is 'fn(key:Any, value:Any) -> None'

    Class PARTIALLY  implements dictionary interface, implementations allows for:

    d = TimeDict(action_time=2, poll_time=0.5)
    insertion:
        d[key] = value
    updating:
        NOTE: updating only changes the value, age remains unchanged
        d[key] = value
    deletion:
        del d[key]
    testing for membership:
        key in d
    checking length:
        len(d)

    Rest of the dictionary interface is not implements by design.
